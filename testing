Detached HEAD indicates that the currently checked-out repository is not a local
branch. This can be caused by the following scenarios:
When a branch is a read-only branch and we try to create a commit to that
branch, then the commits can be termed as “free-floating” commits not
connect to any branch. They would be in a detached state.
When we checkout a tag or a specific commit and then we try to perform a new
commit, then again the commits would not be connect to any branch. When
we now try to checkout a branch, these new commits would be automatically
placed at the top.
